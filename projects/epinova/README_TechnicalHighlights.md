  - Content Targeting: Dynamically displays personalized content blocks, banners, or product listings on webpages.
- **Personalized Recommendations and Promotions:** Combined personalization engine with search results to provide tailored product recommendations and dynamic promotions, enhancing user engagement and driving conversion.

  - Boosting & Scoring: ES query scoring can be customized dynamically to boost products or content that match personalization rules or user preferences.
  - Dynamic Faceting: Faceted filters can be adjusted based on user segments, showing more relevant categories or product attributes.
  - Content Enrichment: Product documents indexed in ES can include metadata fields related to personalization (e.g., tags, popularity, recommended for segment X) to support more granular filtering and sorting.
  - Real-Time Updates: When personalization rules or user segments update, related ES indices can be refreshed or reindexed through event-driven mechanisms to keep search results aligned with current personalization logic.
