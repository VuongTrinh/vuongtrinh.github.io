## Project Overview

This project showcases a production-grade SaaS solution built on Azure with secure private connectivity. It enables multi-tenant SaaS providers to expose services to customers using Private Link, while managing identity, access, and data isolation at scale.

The solution demonstrates core patterns including:
- Private network integration using Azure Private Link.
- Centralized API exposure using Azure API Management.
- Identity federation using Azure Active Directory.
- Secure data access with role-based access control.

This architecture is ideal for ISVs and SaaS vendors building services for regulated industries requiring data privacy and network isolation.
