## 1. Reliability

- Services are distributed across **multiple availability zones** using **Azure Kubernetes Service zone-redundant** with automatic failover and health checks.
- **Azure Service Bus** decouples critical workflows, enabling retries and message durability.
- Resource provisioning and deployment are **automated using GitOps**, reducing manual configuration drift.
- APIs are versioned and exposed via **Azure API Management** with built-in redundancy.

---

## 2. Security

- **Zero Trust architecture** is applied end-to-end using mTLS, Azure AD Workload Identity, Kubernetes's network policies, and RBAC at service level.
- **All traffic is private**: services and APIs are only accessible through **Azure Private Link** and **internal ingress controllers**.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** is enforced using shared-table storage with **row-level security (RLS)** and scoped tokens.
- **Secrets and identity management** via Azure Key Vault and workload identities â€” no embedded secrets or certificates.

## 3. Cost Optimization

- **Shared infrastructure** across tenants using a shared-table multi-tenant database model minimizes resource duplication.
- Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is used with **tenant-level colocation** to balance cost and performance.
- **Autoscaling** and **scale-to-zero** for non-critical services reduce idle costs.

---

## 4. Operational Excellence

- **GitOps with Flux** for declarative deployments of both infrastructure and applications, enabling fast rollback and drift detection.
- **CI/CD pipelines** integrate security scans, automated testing, APIOps, and multi-environment promotion.
- **Azure Managed Applications** and the **Azure Service Catalog** enable controlled, self-service tenant provisioning with built-in policy enforcement and isolation
- Observability through **Azure Monitor**, **Log Analytics**, and **distributed tracing** with Application Insights.

---

## 5. Performance Efficiency

- **Microservices are stateless**, enabling horizontal scaling across nodes and regions.
- Event-driven communication using **Azure Service Bus** (for commands and retries) and **Azure Event Grid** (for pub/sub events) ensures low latency and high throughput with minimal coupling.
- **Distributed caching** and asynchronous processing improve responsiveness for end-user actions.
- **API throttling and rate limiting** via Azure APIM ensure fair use and tenant-level performance control.
