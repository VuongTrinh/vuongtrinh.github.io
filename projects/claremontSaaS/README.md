**Claremont CloudShop** is a cloud-native, multi-tenant e-commerce platform designed to help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) rapidly launch and scale digital storefronts. Built entirely on Microsoft Azure, Claremont offers a flexible, tiered SaaS model—**Starter**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise**—catering to a wide range of customer needs from low-cost onboarding to fully isolated, high-performance enterprise-grade deployments.
As CTO and co-founder, I led the end-to-end technical strategy, platform design, and implementation. Our vision was to combine Azure-native services with a modern software architecture to deliver an affordable, secure, and scalable digital commerce solution.

## Key Business Drivers
- **Time-to-market**: Enable tenants to launch fully functional storefronts in under an hour.
- **Scalability**: Serve thousands of tenants with cost-effective shared infrastructure.
- **Customization**: Allow each tenant to bring their own domain, design, and catalog.
- **Security**: Enforce strong tenant isolation, secure identities, and encrypted communication.
- **Observability & Billing**: Track resource usage per tenant to support tiered billing.

  ## Solution Tiers
- **Starter**: Shared app and shared database; ideal for early-stage businesses.
- **Growth**: Shared app, dedicated database; suited for growing brands with more data volume.
- **Enterprise**: Dedicated app and database; full isolation for performance, compliance, and customization.
