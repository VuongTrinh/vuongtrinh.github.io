- **Clean Architecture**  
  Structured the codebase into layered modules (Domain, Application, Infrastructure), allowing independent testing of business logic without Episerver runtime or CMS-specific bindings.
- **Modular Architecture**  
  Designed the CMS backend as a collection of independent modules (e.g., content rendering, language fallback, metadata providers), each with clear boundaries and minimal interdependencies, enabling parallel development and feature toggling without regressions.
- **Repository Pattern**  
  Abstracted SQL Server interactions via repository interfaces to support dependency injection, enable mocking, and centralize query optimizations for content-heavy operations.
- **Service Layer Pattern**  
  Encapsulated business logic in dedicated service classes (e.g., content publishing, region-based fallback, personalization rules), enabling clean reusability across controllers, jobs, and event handlers.
- **Caching**  
  Engineered a high-performance cache-aside layer backed by Redis and in-memory caching, optimized for partial view rendering and block-level fragment caching with fine-grained invalidation.
- **Dependency Injection**  
  StructureMap IoC container configuration across the solution, enabling testability, dynamic service registration, and separation of wiring logic from implementation code.
- **Domain Events for Decoupled Side Effects**  
  Introduced a domain event dispatcher to decouple side effects (e.g., cache invalidation, logging, analytics triggers) from core workflows, reducing service interdependencies.
- **Specification Pattern for Business Rules**  
  Used specifications to define reusable, composable rules for content filtering, access control, and user segmentation, improving clarity and maintainability of business logic.
- **CQRS-lite**  
  Separated read and write concerns in key flows like content audit logs and navigation trees to optimize performance and reduce coupling between storage and UI.
- **SOLID Principles Across Service Boundaries**  
  Consistently applied SOLID principles to all backend services and CMS extensions, leading to loosely coupled components that enabled safe parallel development and easier refactoring.
