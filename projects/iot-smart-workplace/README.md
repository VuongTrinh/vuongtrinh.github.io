## Highlights

- **IoT Edge with LoRaWAN Gateways**  
  On-premises sensors deployed via LoRaWAN gateways collect temperature, humidity, COâ‚‚, light, and other environmental data, enabling localized preprocessing and resilient edge computing.

- **Multi-Region Azure IoT Hub Gateway**  
  Optimized routing of device telemetry to the nearest Azure region ensures low latency, high availability, and scalable device management with secure, consistent global connectivity.

- **End-to-End IoT Data Pipeline on Databricks**  
  Real-time ingestion of sensor data through structured streaming, coupled with scalable storage and feature engineering inside a robust multi-tenant architecture.

- **Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Occupancy Prediction**  
  An ensemble approach combining a deep learning neural network with traditional machine learning models delivers accurate regression-based occupant count predictions.

- **Serverless Multi-Tenant Application**  
  Each tenant has access to a serverless application enabling scalable querying of large datasets stored in Delta Lake, powering real-time dashboards and comprehensive reporting.

- **MLOps with MLflow on Databricks**  
  Fully automated lifecycle management for model training, versioning, and deployment ensures reproducibility and continuous improvement of predictive models.
