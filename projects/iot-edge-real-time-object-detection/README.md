## Highlights
- Deployed on **edge-located Kubernetes clusters**, allows lifecycle management, and governance across multiple edge sites from Azure.
- Performs **real-time object detection** using **deep learning model** to analyze live video streams directly at the edge.
- Implements an **event-driven microservices architecture**, featuring an MQTT message broker with publish/subscribe semantics to handle edge-local events efficiently.
- Enables full **MLOps workflows** including model registration, versioning, and deployment through Azure Machine Learning to Arc-connected Kubernetes clusters, ensuring consistent, traceable model execution at the edge.
- Supports **hybrid edge-to-cloud connectivity**, with local inference and data processing that continues to operate even when offline, and syncs state to the cloud when connectivity is restored.
- Built on a **modular, cloud-native foundation** using containerized services and declarative configuration, enabling rapid extension to new use cases and deployment to various edge environments.
